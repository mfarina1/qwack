# Qwack

This is a quantum computing 2D platform game created with IBM's Qiskit and PyGame. It was developed by Madeline Farina, Adam Van Belkum, and Rishi Challa in the spring of 2021 for University of Florida's CIS4914 Senior Project course. 

## Description

Our goal for this game is to teach quantum concepts to beginners, particularly younger audiences. By interacting with said concepts via video game, the player is able to gain a more intuitive understanding of how certain quantum concepts like superposition or entanglement work. Because it is customary to name a quantum application something starting with “Q” (like QPong or Quirk), and since we wanted our game’s main character to be some kind of cute animal sprite, we settled on the name “Qwack” with the main character being a duck named Dr. Qwack to connect the two concepts. The game was developed using PyGame, a module for the Python programming language, and Qiskit, a quantum programming framework developed by IBM, all in a Jupyter Notebook. If all the appropriate Python packages are installed beforehand, Qwack can be run real time on one’s computer. 


## Installation
To play the game, you must install Python and several required packages using the command line (Command Prompt for Windows or Terminal for macOS). 

On Windows, open Command Prompt by typing "Command Prompt" on the search box of Start menu. Check this link if you are not sure about how to do that: https://www.wikihow.com/Open-the-Command-Prompt-in-Windows

On macOS, press Command + Space to open Spotlight. Type "Terminal" on Spotlight to open Terminal. Check this link if you are not sure about how to do that: https://www.wikihow.com/Open-a-Terminal-Window-in-Mac

### Install Python
You can install Python from https://www.python.org/ or install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com

### Install required packages
There are three Python packages required to run the game: PyGame, Qiskit and matplotlib.

Run `pip install [package name]` on command line tool (same for Windows and macOS) to install the packages. For example:
```console
pip install pygame
```
### Install Qwack

Clone or download the main branch by clicking the green button on the top right corner on this page (above the files and below "contributors"). Unzip the files to the "Downloads" folder on your computer.

Change the directory to the downloaded files. (Downloads/qwack)

## How to play

Playing Qwack involves using your mouse for menu options and moving the duck sprite around with the arrow keys. More Control instructions can be found in the Controls section of the main menu and in the dialogue throughout the game.
